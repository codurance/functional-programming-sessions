# fp-sesions
Katas performed as part of the FP sessions.

We will be following the following Functional Calisthenics rules:

1. Side effects only at the boundaries. Free Monads, Monads Transformers, IO

2. No mutable state

3. No unit/void return types

4. Only 1 argument functions.  Relax for implementations in languages that do not support currying

5. No explicity recursion.

6. Generic building blocks, e.g. lists, functors, monads, monoids

7. Constraint domain concepts at the boundaries

8. Always infite sequences

9. Exhaustive conditional & pattern matchting

10. Name everything

11. Do NOT use intermediates.

12. Do NOT abbreviate

13. Only complete functions

14. Function composition & pipelines
